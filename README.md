<h1>Week 3 - Task 2</h1>
There are multiple free/OSS or commercial solutions aiming to solve common problems with ticketing systems. One of them is [JIRA alert](https://github.com/prometheus-community/jiralert) 
which is part of open-source Prometheus ecosystems and integrates Alertmanager with Atlassian's JIRA issue tracker. JIRAlert implements Alertmanager's webhook HTTP API and connects to one or more 
JIRA instances to create highly configurable JIRA issues.

low-severity incidents and integration with popular issue tracking system such as JIRA
